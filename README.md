# Movie Script Analyzer
A webscraping script that fetches all the movie title data for each of the 18 genres on IMDb. Specifically gets each title's rating and box office data, as well as performs sentiment analysis on the movie script using the NRC Lexicon in order to get the % of the script that expresses 10 different emotions and sentiments. 

The data is then exported to a CSV file where a correlation analysis is done with each metric and the rating/box office data.

# Motivations
In the present day, the entertainment industry is constantly evolving toward making the most enjoyable and profitable sources of film entertainment. Through the use of movie rating sites, we can now decide whether or not it is worth the trip to the movie theatre to watch a particular movie.

With this in mind, I was interested in seeing if there was a correlation between the online movie ratings and the box office potential it has, as well as seeing if certain sentiments expressed in movies could have an impact on either metric.
